> <div align='center'>This is a game made with Phaser.js. A javascript library to make browser based games. It's a basic game where you have to collect coins and the score increases randomly, with every (3000) scores increased the speed will be increased by (.2) and after (15000) score the speed will be increased by (.5) means (2.3). And yes if you touch the wall the game will be over and if you touch the white boxes the game will be over. Thank you. Enjoy.</div>
